# Exercises, labs, and other snippets

I'm currently studying Software Engineering (B.Sc.) at [Chalmers University of Technology](http.//chalmers.se), where we're taking courses in object-oriented programming. I'm storing some stuff from labs and such here at GitHub.

## TDA545 - "Object-Oriented Programming"

- **Language:** Java
- **Period:** Fall 2011
- **Contents:** Basic OO concepts, Swing, recursion, and more.
- **Labs**
	- Lab 1: Not included. Basic Unix stuff.
	- Lab 2: Exercises OO concepts with rational numbers. Also includes some array training.
	- Lab 3: More OO. Includes interfaces, inheritance, Swing, and some MVC. Part 2 ('del2') treats recursion with the [Secant Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method) as an example.
	- Lab 4: Full blown Swing lab. A memory game. Compile, and give it a try :)

## TDA550 - "Object-Oriented Programming, Intermediate level"

- **Language:** Java
- **Period:** Fall 2011
- **Contents:** Elaborate OO concepts, design patterns, advanced inheritance and more.
- **Labs**
	- Lab 1: Use of a pre-written game framework. Create a "SnakeModel".
	- Lab 2: Geometric shapes. Exercise of OO concepts and avoiding pitfalls.
	- Lab 3: Refactoring the game framework according to an MVC pattern.
	
## Disclaimer

The code in the 'lab' directory is written by me, **Johan Brook**, and **Robin Andersson**. All other Java code is written by me, or otherwise noted (our teacher has provided test code on some places).

I can't guarantee all code in the `exercises` directory is compilable.
